# How to use

You will need RUST (See https://rustup.rs/ on how to install it)

After installing Rust you can use `cargo install --git https://github.com/MTRNord/OSM_to_Euroscope.git` to install the Application.

To use the Application you currently need to get you OSM Data manually. I suggest using [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) with the pbf plugin.

If you got your data from there (Just save a layer with OSM data to the osm.pbf format) you can use the following Command currently:

```shell script
$ OSM_to_Euroscope taxiways -a=<ICAO ID OF YOUR AIRPORT> -i=<THE OSM DATA FILE>
```

This command will generate the GROUND layout of the taxiways to a file named `<ICAO ID OF YOUR AIRPORT>.ese` inside the out folder.


## WARNING!! THE QUALITY OF THE RESULT HIGHLY DEPENDS ON THE QUALITY OF THE MAPPED DATA!

## Tips for better results

1. Merge as many line parts as possible of one taxiway
2. Atleast keep the Lines all oriented in the exact same way as otherwise Euroscope gets confused
3. You might need to manually connect paths to make them look real. ***DO NOT!!*** make curves like in real life as it confuses Euroscope currently in the way the data gets generated by this script. Use straight connections for now!
4. Make sure the lines are correctly tagged. (`aeroway = taxiway` and `ref = <TAXIWAY IDENTIFIER (like D1)`)
